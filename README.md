# GitHowTo Course
_Thus, here as a reminder._
## Info
Small step-by-step Git course, that consists of 50 lessons, during which I imporved my knowladge in general Git concepts, basic instruments, conflicts resolution and remote repositories.

Each of the folders (except hello.git) is a repository that somehow was used in the lessons.
